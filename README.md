# The-Twittler
In this Twittler project we were given a random tweet generator file and were asked to build a front-end that meets the following requirements. 
-Show the new user tweets somehow. Automatically, or create a button that displays new tweets
-Display the time-stamps of when the tweets were created in a human-friendly way (e.g. "10 minutes ago") 
-Design the interface so that you want to look at and use the product you're making
-Allow the user to click on a username to see that user's timeline
